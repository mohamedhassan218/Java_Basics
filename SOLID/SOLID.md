## In this folder I've implemented simple classes to implement what I had learnt about the SOLID principles.


- Single Responsibility:
	Each class should have only one sole purpose,
	and not be filled with excessive functionalities.
- Open Closed:
	Classes should be open for extension but closed 
	for modification.
- Liskov Substitution:
	Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable 
	for their base class.
- Interface Segregation:
	Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they 
	can't do. 
	Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.
- Dependency Inversion:
	Components should depend on abstractions, not on cncretions.
